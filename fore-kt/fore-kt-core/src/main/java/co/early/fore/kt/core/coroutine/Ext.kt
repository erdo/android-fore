 *
 * Testing unwrapped co-routines is not as straight forward as it could be, depending on
 * kotlinx-coroutines-test, was not giving us determinate test results at
 * the moment - and for unit tests that's a total deal breaker. It's ok to test single suspend
 * functions, but not if you want to test units of code that contain more than one suspend function
 * and use a mixture of IO and Main dispatchers.
 *
 * There is a complicated discussion about that here: https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines/pull/1206
 *
 * In any case https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines/blob/coroutines-test/kotlinx-coroutines-test/README.md
 * is focussed on swapping out the main dispatcher for unit tests. Even with runBlockingTest, other dispatchers can
 * still run concurrently with your tests, making tests much more complicated. The whole thing is extremely
 * complicated in fact (which is probably why it doesn't work yet).
 *
 * For the moment we continue to use the very simple and clear WorkMode switch as we have done in the past.
 * SYNCHRONOUS means everything is run sequentially in a blocking manner and on whatever thread the caller
 * is on. ASYNCHRONOUS gives you the co-routine behaviour you would expect.
 *
 * NB. This means there is no virtual time unless you implement it yourself though, for instance if you have code
 * like this in your app: delay(10 000), it will sit there and wait during a unit test, same as it would in app code.
 * You can write something like this instead: delay(if (workMode == WorkMode.ASYNCHRONOUS) 10000 else 1)
 *
 * Update Jan 2022: hopefully the reworked version of kotlinx-coroutines-test for 1.6 is going to fix these
 * issues: https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2021/12/introducing-kotlinx-coroutines-1-6-0/
 * The fore extension methods will remain as a convenience or just to use if you prefer testing asynchronous
 * code by making them synchronous for tests
