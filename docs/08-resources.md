# Presentations

There are a couple of presentations hosted on surge that I occasionally use, they might be useful for you too. They don't really work on mobile though, (they are almost useable if you put your mobile browser in full screen mode and use left and right swipes to navigate).

They were written using [spectacle](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle) which is an awesome ReactJS presentation library.


### Android architecture basics
This spells out the main problem with the default android architecture and the motivation for using libraries like ASAF in the first place. I think many android developers don't realise this, even though with hindsight it kind of stares you in the face.

(if you open those two links on separate tabs of the same browser, the slides will automatically keep themselves in sync)


### ASAF basics
This one takes you though all the important points of ASAF together with a lot of examples. I don't think it really adds anything that isn't already in these docs - it's like a quick summary version.

# Coding Exercise

In my day job I often take new developers through the basics of ASAF and I've found the most effective way of doing this (aside from pointing them in the direction of these docs) is to get them to do a basic two page android app. I give them as much time as they need as the focus should be on learning and understanding rather than producing code. They typically take between a few days and a week, although once they know what they are doing they could easily complete the whole thing in an hour or so.

What I find truly fascinating is that the feedback I give them once they have finished, tends to be around 75% identical. I could almost copy and paste my feedback from the last developer and just change the lines of code that I am referring to.

As the mistakes made are all so similar, I plan to add an equivalent exercise here together with the standard feedback, so that the reader can use it themselves, or with their team.

Stay tuned....
