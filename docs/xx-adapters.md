# Cursor Loaders

Cursor loaders are interesing, underneath the hood they use a standard observer pattern to propogate their changes to a view just as this library does. It works very nicely, the only criticism I have is that (as with so much Android code) it forces you down a path of adding model code to the Activity and Fragment classes.
